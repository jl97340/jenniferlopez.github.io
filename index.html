            <h3> Behind the Name</h3>
              <p>Welcome to my first blog post!</p>
            <p>I am so excited to share my new platform where I can share my thoughts and inspiration daily. As part of my transition into the blogging world, I thought it would be nice to share
              my inspiration for the title of my blog "Espiritu Libre." The name itself is a Spanish translation meaning "free-spirit", and that is exactly why I chose to name it that!
              I am very much impacted daily by this saying, whether it be through my fashion style or my personality. I have an easy going, peaceful mindset and I love to show it physically and mentally in my life!
              I also love showing both diverse sides of my culture through my fashion choices, taking inspiration from vibrant, fun driven Mexican styles and also the bohemian, country look I have grown accustomed to seeing in South GA.
              I hope I am able to influence other young, diverse "free-spirits" out there find a little encouragement to be their best selves in the world!

                <h3>What I'm Loving at the Moment</h3>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                      <li>Gold Dainty Chokers:</li>
                          <li> The simplicity of these jewelry pieces adds a delicate statement to any outfit. Being a freshman college student, I have unwittedly realized that casual, comfortable outfits are the way to go from now on during school.
                            The color of these pieces can help anyone feel a little more chic in their casual outfits!
                          </li>
                      <li>Oversized Jean Jackets:</li>
                            <li>Going along with the theme of comfort and fashionable outfits, the classic jean jacket makes any outfit instantly become a new look. 
                              It's also breathable enough to wear during these upcoming warm Spring days!
                            </li>
                        
                      <li>Printed Tshirts:</li>
                            <li>Do I really have to emphasize the comfortable theme I have going in my life right now? 
                              Tshirts have definitely always been a staple in my closet, but I could never bring myself to style them in a fashion-forward way until I discovered the endless possibilities of wearing them!
                              Wearing them with a jacket over top or even tying it a different way can add some flare into your everyday look.
